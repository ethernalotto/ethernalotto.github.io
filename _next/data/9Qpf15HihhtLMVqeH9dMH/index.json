{"pageProps":{"source":"# Goodbye\n\nDear valued users and supporters of our decentralized lottery project,\n\nIt is with great sadness that we announce the closure of our project. Despite our best efforts, we\nwere unable to secure the necessary financing to continue the development of the platform.\nAdditionally, the excessive regulation of the lottery industry has made investors unconfident about\nthe project, leading to a lack of funding.\n\nWe want to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who supported us throughout the project's\ndevelopment. We believed that a decentralized lottery could revolutionize the gambling industry,\nproviding greater transparency, fairness, and accessibility for players. However, it is not us who\nwill make this a reality.\n\nWhile this may be the end of our journey, we still believe that a decentralized lottery is good for\nhumanity. It has the potential to provide a fairer and more transparent gambling experience for\neveryone, while also reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. We hope that others will continue to\npursue this vision and that a decentralized lottery will become a reality in the future.\n\nAs a parting gift, we have decided to leave all our smartcontracts open source on GitHub. This means\nthat anyone who wants to continue the development of a decentralized lottery can access our code and\nbuild upon it. We hope that this will encourage others to continue our mission and make a\ndecentralized lottery a reality.\n\nOnce again, we want to thank everyone who supported us throughout this project, and we apologize for\nany inconvenience caused by our closure. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not\nhesitate to contact us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe EthernaLotto team\n\n---\n\nLink to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/ethernalotto/lottery\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
