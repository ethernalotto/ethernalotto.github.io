<p>Dear valued users and supporters of our decentralized lottery project,</p>
<p>It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of our project. Despite our best efforts, we
were unable to secure the necessary financing to continue the development of the platform.
Additionally, the excessive regulation of the lottery industry has made investors unconfident about
the project, leading to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>We want to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who supported us throughout the project&#x27;s
development. We believed that a decentralized lottery could revolutionize the gambling industry,
providing greater transparency, fairness, and accessibility for players. However, it is not us who
will make this a reality.</p>
<p>While this may be the end of our journey, we still believe that a decentralized lottery is good for
humanity. It has the potential to provide a fairer and more transparent gambling experience for
everyone, while also reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. We hope that others will continue to
pursue this vision and that a decentralized lottery will become a reality in the future.</p>
<p>As a parting gift, we have decided to leave all our smartcontracts open source on GitHub. This means
that anyone who wants to continue the development of a decentralized lottery can access our code and
build upon it. We hope that this will encourage others to continue our mission and make a
decentralized lottery a reality.</p>
<p>Once again, we want to thank everyone who supported us throughout this project, and we apologize for
any inconvenience caused by our closure. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not
hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The EthernaLotto team</p>
